This is an advanced version of the classic Brick Breaker game with multiple levels, increasing difficulty, particle effects, and a high score tracking system. Players can progress through levels by breaking all the bricks while avoiding the ball from falling off the screen. Indestructible bricks are added in higher levels for extra challenge.

Features
Multiple Levels: Levels become harder with increased ball speed and more indestructible bricks.

Particle Effects: Visual particles upon breaking bricks.

Ball Trail Effect: Enhanced graphics using ball trails.

High Score Management: Persistent high score storage using a text file.

Dynamic Background: Animated background color transition.
